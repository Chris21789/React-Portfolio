WHEN I am presented with the Portfolio section
THEN I see titled images of six of the developerâ€™s applications with links to both the deployed 
applications and the corresponding GitHub repositories

WHEN I am presented with the Contact section
THEN I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message

WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text
THEN I receive a notification that this field is required

WHEN I enter text into the email address field
THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address
